## Dependencies (important)
Use a recent version of [nba_py](https://github.com/seemethere/nba_py). The version as of writing (17-Nov-17) on PyPi is out of date. In other words, `pip install -r requirements.txt` will cause errors. You can install all requirements from `requirements.txt`, uninstall the found version of nba_py and then reinstall from an updated source.

Please clone nba_py and install via `pip install /path/to/nba_py`. Commit `ffeaf4251d796ff9313367a752a45a0d7b16489e` is verified compatible.
